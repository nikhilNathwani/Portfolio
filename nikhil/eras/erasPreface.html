          <h1>Why did I do this?</h1>
          <p>
            It's hard to appreciate an NBA era while it's in progress. When I started watching basketball, I didn't realize the mediocre Celtics team lead by Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker would become (for better or for worse) a memorable slice of Celtics history. Or at least Nikhil history.
          </p>
          <p>  
            I (irrationally?) loved that squad. Granted, I was an impressionable young'n and had all-time homer Tommy Heinsohn explain basketball to me (I was convinced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbEQfmwh-fg" target="_blank">I loved Walter</a> McCarty...true Celtic fans will understand). But regardless, each game had its wild moments, making me feel those extreme forms of excitement and disappointment that regular preteen life never necessitated. Perhaps above all else, that Celtics era gave me a childhood hero in Paul Pierce, a relentless fighter I could count on to make everything okay when games went awry and players came and went.
          </p>
          <p>
            This made me curious...what about all those eras that I missed? I never saw Larry Bird or Bill Russell; what did the team look like when they were around? And what about the 29 other teams?! Each team has a story that can be illustrated by the heroic, franchise-defining players that carried it. I can't tell all these stories, but I can capture a snapshot. Go ahead and check out <a href="eras.html">your team's timeline</a> -- I dare you to stave off the warm fuzzy nostalgia. You can't.
          </p>
          
          <h1 id="learned">What can be learned from the timeline?</h1>
		  <p>
			Before making any conclusions from the timeline, it's important to understand why certain players appear and others don't. The <a href="erasMath.html">math section</a> covers this in detail, but the gist is this: given the <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html" target="_blank">win share</a> leaders over a team's history, the timeline contains the fewest number of players necessary to cover 40% of the team's regular season wins each season. (Why 40%? Because I liked the way the results looked.)
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Ideally, all teams' timelines should contain their "best" players of each season. So what insights can we gather when looking at this information? I don't want to get in the way of anyone's creative thinking, but here are some questions you could ask yourself while looking at the timelines:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>What differentiates dynasties from one-off champions? (color-coded data points show which teams won titles)</li>
			<li>Do the Celtics have a "better" history than the Lakers?</li>
			<li>Why didn't Malone and Stockton ever win together? And why hasn't Washington won since '78?</li>
			<li>Which years mark a distinct era change for your favorite team?</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			The answers to some of these questions are not clear-cut and cannot be definitively answered just from the data in this visualization. But the timelines certainly can serve as a springboard for conversation or further research (click on data points to access more info). What does the visualization tell YOU?
