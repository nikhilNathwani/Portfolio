          <h1>Why did I do this?</h1>
          <p>
            This past August, I met a 12-year-old Kosovan kid on a flight from Istanbul to Boston (this is about as interesting as my life gets). I don't know what 12-year-olds talk about these days so I asked him about school. He ranted about how it was RIDICULOUS to learn history every year, which resonated with me because I've felt the same way. But, as the responsible adult in this situation I felt obligated to justify his suffering (albeit in the most cliche way possible): "I hear you man, but learning history actually is important! It helps you make decisions in the future!"
          </p>
          <p>  
            And with that, I probably sounded like every adult he'd ever talked to. It killed me. I started racking my brain for at least an example to share, but I blanked. I thought about it again weeks later and came up with something:
          </p>
          <p>
			NBA teams look into the trove of league history for ideas on which systems thrive and which don't. This isn't news. But does this translate into success? Which past teams do the current teams draw inspiration from? If the future really does benefit from historical record, then 2014 playoff teams with similarities to past successful teams should have performed well themselves. In the spirit of this conjecture, I wanted to create a <a href="neighbors.html">visualization</a> that provides a quick snapshot history's influence on each 2014 playoff team. 
          </p>
          
          <h1 id="learned">What can be learned from the playoff orbits?</h1>
		  <p>
			
		  </p>
		  <p>
			I refer to the visualizations I made for each team as "playoff success orbits", simply because they resemble solar systems. In the center of an orbit is a 2014 playoff team, and around it are dots corresponding to the most similar playoff teams of the past (dots are colored-coded by team logo colors). The size of each orbiting dot is proportional to the number of playoff series the corresponding team won, and the distance from the center is proportional to how "similar" the team is to the 2014 team in question ("similar" is as defined in the <a href="math.html">math section<a> ).
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Teams with lots of big dots in their orbit (OKC, MIA, SAS) had playoff success in their DNA. And teams with many little dots close to the center (TOR, BRK, MEM, etc.) weren't set up for long playoff runs. With this in mind, just quickly scanning the orbits can give you a sense of a team's potential. You can also click around to get more info on each orbiting team. Here are a few interesting things I picked up on from the orbits:
  		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>The Spurs are the model of consistency, with Popovich's system remaining intact. But in some way, this system seems to draw from the Bird-era Celtics!</li>
			<li>Paul Pierce brought some of Boston with him to Brooklyn.</li>
			<li>The Clippers picked up tricks from their Staples Center roommates (i.e. Coach Doc Rivers's former rival).</li>
			<li>I subconciously relate everything to the Celtics.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>
			My message to the young people is that history CAN be important. And there certainly are more secrets to be uncovered by the playoff orbits that aren't stated here. Go ahead and investigate! What does the <a href="neighbors.html">visualization</a> tell YOU?
